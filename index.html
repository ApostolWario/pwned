  Title:       Adobe
  Name:        Adobe
  Domain:      adobe.com
  BreachDate:  2013-10-04
  AddedDate:   2013-12-04T00:00:00Z
  PwnCount:    152445165
  Description: In October 2013, 153 million Adobe accounts were breached with each containing an internal ID, username, email, &lt;em&gt;encrypted&lt;/em&gt; password and a password hint in plain text. The password cryptography was poorly done and &lt;a href="http://stricture-group.com/files/adobe-top100.txt" target="_blank"&gt;many were quickly resolved back to plain text&lt;/a&gt;. The unencrypted hints also &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/11/adobe-credentials-and-serious.html" target="_blank"&gt;disclosed much about the passwords&lt;/a&gt; adding further to the risk that hundreds of millions of Adobe customers already faced.
  DataClasses:
    - Email addresses
    - Password hints
    - Passwords
    - Usernames
  IsVerified:  true
  IsSensitive: false
  IsActive:    true
  IsRetired:   false
